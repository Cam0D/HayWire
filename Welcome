In the far future, the museum of 21st century science has entered lockdown after an earthquake caused the security AI to go haywire. You are a newly hired electrical engineer who has been trapped inside. You must solve a series of puzzles as you traverse the physics wing of the museum in order to reach the control room, and shut down the AI. HayWire was created as part of a university capstone project for the purpose, and was designed as a roadshow game in order to promote enthusiasm for science among Queensland high school students.
